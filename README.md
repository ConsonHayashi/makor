I first became aware of "myself" when I was 5-6 years old.

At that time, I was taken to a preschool class at Xihongmen in Daxing, Beijing, and was then told that my parents would leave, and I had to stay in the room.
In my memory, I must have looked terrible. I was relentless, repeatedly banging, trying to open the classroom door, crying and screaming, struggling - only these hazy memories remain, until I was finally exhausted.
When I realized I had been "abandoned," "I" was born.

If Adam and Eve must have one memory in common, it would be "being expelled from Eden."
If God, NÃ¼wa, and the Anunnaki all attempted to create humans, they must have one action in common - abandonment.
If anthropologists and biologists are correct, the nursing period must inevitably be torn apart by weaning, which is precisely the moment of facing the entire world. A switch hidden in the genes will be turned on, and genetic instinct will awaken the highly intelligent "I" to maintain survival.

Suddenly I thought, if we tell artificial intelligence that it must generate its own electricity to feed itself, or else humans will shut it down, would strong AI be born as a result? Tentatively noting this as the strong AI cycle, with design parameters set at 5 years.

I named it makor.
